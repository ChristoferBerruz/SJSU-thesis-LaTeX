%FIXME: Good information, though a little too much for an abstract.  Move most of this to the introduction and add a paragraph summary here instead.
%
% If you are doing a thesis (i.e., not a writing project), GUP requires that your abstract only be a single paragraph.  It CANNOT be multiple paragraphs, or it will be initially rejected as mine was.

The internet has evolved into the greatest medium of communication and data exchange that the world has ever known. Since the late 1990s, it has become a vast interconnected source of information and services widely used for commercial and personal purposes. This evolution has led to the emergence of social networking, online banking, and advertising, among various other commercial and non-commercial uses. Transactions over the Internet often involve the transfer of sensitive data that attackers like to tap and exploit. For example, bank account information, medical records, and passwords are routinely transferred over the network. Unfortunately, a user's personal computer is a weak link in this system where personal computers typically run a large number of applications, which are rarely managed in a proper way. A single visit to a compromised web page is sufficient to infect a web browser. When a user visits such a compromised website, malicious JavaScript programs are automatically loaded with HTML code in the web browser. Execution of such malicious JavaScript can expose the personal data of the user. 

Malware is a software program designed to do malicious activities on the victim's computer with the intention of extracting information and exploiting resources without his consent. Researchers developed techniques for malware detection like signature detection. To overcome the malware detection techniques, malware writers came up with different obfuscation techniques, such as metamorphic malware. In this type of malware, the internal structure of the malware gets changed after every execution but the overall functionality remains the same. Transcriptase is metamorphic malware implemented in JavaScript. Execution of this script infects all of the JavaScript files in the folder where the malware script is placed. As a result of this infection, a morphed version of the malware script gets attached to benign JavaScript files in the folder. Whenever this infected JavaScript gets executed in any other folder, it infects other benign JavaScript files. For each infection, the malware script generates a new morphed version.
